Operator: Hello, and welcome to the Darden Fiscal Year 2024 Third Quarter Earnings Call.

Kevin Kalicak, Senior Vice President - Finance & Investor Relations: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. Joining me today are Rick Cardenas, Darden's President and CEO; and Raj Vennam, CFO.

Rick Cardenas, President, CEO & Director: Good morning, everyone. I'm proud of our results this quarter. Each one of our segments grew total sales and profit in an operating environment that was tougher than we anticipated. We continued to outperform the industry benchmarks for same-restaurant sales and traffic. Total sales were $3 billion, an increase of 6.8%, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $2.62, in line with our expectations. We opened 16 restaurants during this quarter. Fiscal year-to-date, we have opened 43 restaurants in 22 states, 7 of which were reopenings.

The quarter started well with strong holiday performance in December, but unfavorable winter weather negatively impacted January traffic. The lower-income consumer appears to be pulling back and the mix of guests, based on income, is now in line with pre-COVID. Despite industry traffic trends weakening, we gained share. 

Our competitive advantages include significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning, and our results-oriented culture. Our teams performed well, setting sales records in December and February.

Rajesh Vennam, CFO: Thank you, Rick. Third quarter earnings were in line with our expectations, although sales were softer than anticipated. We generated $3 billion of total sales, 6.8% higher than last year, driven by the acquisition of Ruth's Chris Steak House and 55 net new restaurants, partially offset by negative same-restaurant sales of 1%.

We outperformed the industry again this quarter with same-restaurant sales 320 basis points better than the industry and same-restaurant guest counts 270 basis points better. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.62, an increase of 12% from last year. We generated $512 million of adjusted EBITDA and returned approximately $190 million of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.

Margins improved due to pricing leverage and strong cost management. We expect fiscal 2024 total sales of approximately $11.4 billion and adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $8.80 to $8.90.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION:
Eric Gonzalez, KeyBanc: Asked about the low-income consumer pulling back and brand differences.

Rick Cardenas: Transactions from households with incomes below $75,000 were lower than last year, most pronounced in Fine Dining.

Brian Bittner, Oppenheimer: Asked about industry sales impact and strategy adjustments.

Rick Cardenas: We plan to stick to our strategy of everyday value and focus on execution, food, service, and atmosphere to drive results.

David Tarantino, Baird: Inquired about how the company would manage if the environment worsens and pricing philosophy.

Rick Cardenas: We have levers to pull but will not shift to heavy promotional strategies. We will continue pricing below inflation.

Jeffrey Bernstein, Barclays: Asked about operating environment challenges and industry trends.

Rick Cardenas: The challenges are broader market issues rather than internal missteps. The entire industry saw negative traffic in the quarter.

Rajesh Vennam: Mix improved quarter-to-quarter, and off-premise sales remained stable with strong execution.

Jon Tower, Citigroup: Inquired about marketing visibility and new restaurant growth.

Rick Cardenas: Marketing spend remains prudent, focusing on long-term brand equity. Construction costs and timelines are impacting new openings.

Andrew Strelzik, BMO: Asked about industry capacity and unit growth expectations.

Rick Cardenas: The focus remains on core equities and everyday value without deep discounting. We are seeing some trade-down within brands.

Patrick Johnson, Stifel: Inquired about menu innovation at Olive Garden and LongHorn.

Rick Cardenas: Innovation focuses on balance between new items and improving existing ones while maintaining menu simplicity.

Lauren Silberman, Deutsche Bank: Followed up on sales guidance and G&A expectations.

Rajesh Vennam: G&A expected around $440 million for the year. Sales expectations were adjusted, but cost management and productivity gains help meet earnings guidance.

Peter Saleh, BTIG: Asked about traffic softness and consumer behavior.

Rajesh Vennam: Traffic management improvements are observed, especially among older consumers shifting to lunch.

Brian Vaccaro, Raymond James: Inquired about Olive Garden and LongHorn traffic and market share.

The call concluded with management reiterating their focus on long-term strategy, brand equity, and disciplined execution to navigate the challenging operating environment.
